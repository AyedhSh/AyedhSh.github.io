      <h3>HTML Markup</h3>
      <div class="cover">
        <p><b>HTML</b>:(Hypertext Markup Language) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted in a file intended for display on a World Wide Web browser page. Each individual markup code is referred to as an element (but many people also refer to it as a tag).</p>

      <h3>CSS Styling</h3>
      <div class="cover">
        <p><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>(CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.<b> CSS </b> is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts.</p>

      <h3>Ruby</h3>
      <p>A <b>ruby</b> is a pink to blood-red colored gemstone, a variety of the mineral corundum (aluminium oxide). Other varieties of gem-quality corundum are called sapphires. Ruby is one of the traditional cardinal gems, together with amethyst, sapphire, emerald, and diamond. They word ruby comes from ruber, Latin for red.</p>

      <h3>Rails</h3>
      <p>The principle difference between <b>Ruby on Rails</b> and other frameworks for development lies in the speed and ease of use that developers working within the environment enjoy. Changes made to applications are immediately applied, avoiding the time consuming steps normally associated with the web development cycle. According to David Geary, a Java expert, the Ruby-based framework is five to 10 times faster than comparable Java-based frameworks. </p>

      <h3>Rails</h3>
      <p><b>JavaScript</b> is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it, and all modern Web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.</p>

      <h3>C++ Language </h3>
      <p><b>C++</b> is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained and large systems, with performance, efficiency and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes). C++ is a compiled language, with implementations of it available on many platforms and provided by various organizations, including the Free Software Foundation (FSF's GCC), LLVM, Microsoft, Intel and IBM.</p>
