  "before": "My name is Ayedh and I grew up east of Anbar Fallujah and I displaced from Anbar to Erbil in 2014. After high school I studied computer science and information technology then worked in iraqi ministry of education for a few years.",
  "joined": "While I was studying and while I was working I found that I was always interested in coding and trying to learn it in my spare time.
